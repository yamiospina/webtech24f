            <h2>What is the objective of your website? </h2>
            For my term project, my objective will be to demonstrate the design of a website that provides data 
            about needle thread related crafts and explanations about them. In the website users will be able to 
            review the similarties and differences between the types of crafts-ex.crocheting, knitting, punch needle.
            This demosntration will include only 4 types of needle thread activties, and include tutorials and examples of each.
        </p>

        <p>
            <h2>who is the target audience for your website?</h2>
           My website aims to help young adults discover a new craft hobby or learn how to make new needle related projects.
           As well as direct to places they can buy supplies or go to make crafts 
        </p>

        <p>
            <h2>what content do you plan to include in each page?</h2>
            In my website I would like to include about 5 pages. One describing the different activites 
            (this would have about 4 subpages for each). Include one of places in Boston that make or have 
            lessons to create these projects. An about me page, that talk about why I wanted to build this website 
            and includ esome of my own designs too.
